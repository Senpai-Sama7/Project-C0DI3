## 9. Using Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) üÜï

CAG is like having a super-fast memory for cybersecurity questions. It remembers previous answers and gives you instant responses for similar questions.

### **What is CAG?**
- **Faster Responses**: Get answers in milliseconds instead of seconds
- **Smart Memory**: Remembers similar questions and their answers
- **Always Learning**: Gets smarter with each question you ask
- **Privacy Safe**: All memory stays on your computer

### **Basic CAG Commands**

#### **Ask a Question with CAG**
```bash
# Ask about cybersecurity topics
core-agent cag:query "What is SQL injection?"

# Ask with specific options
core-agent cag:query "How to detect malware?" --category blue-team --difficulty intermediate
```

#### **Check Cache Performance**
```bash
# See how well CAG is performing
core-agent cag:stats
```

#### **Clear the Cache (if needed)**
```bash
# Clear all cached answers
core-agent cag:clear
```

#### **Pre-load Common Questions**
```bash
# Load common cybersecurity questions for instant answers
core-agent cag:prewarm
```

### **CAG vs Regular Queries**

| Type | Speed | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **CAG Query** | Very Fast (50-200ms) | Repeated questions, similar topics |
| **Regular Query** | Normal (2-5 seconds) | New questions, unique topics |

### **When to Use CAG**
‚úÖ **Use CAG for:**
- Questions you've asked before
- Similar cybersecurity topics
- Quick reference lookups
- Training and learning sessions

‚ùå **Use Regular Queries for:**
- Completely new topics
- Unique scenarios
- When you want fresh analysis

### **CAG Tips**
1. **Start with Pre-warming**: Run `cag:prewarm` to load common questions
2. **Check Stats**: Use `cag:stats` to see how well it's working
3. **Clear When Needed**: Use `cag:clear` if you want fresh answers
4. **Combine with Learning**: Use CAG during training missions for faster feedback

### **Advanced CAG Features**

#### **Export/Import Cache**
```bash
# Save your cache to a file
core-agent cag:export my-cache.json

# Load cache from a file
core-agent cag:import my-cache.json
```

#### **Benchmark Performance**
```bash
# Test CAG performance with your own questions
# First, create a file called queries.json with your questions:
# ["What is phishing?", "How to secure a network?", ...]
core-agent cag:benchmark queries.json
```

### **CAG in Practice**

**Scenario 1: Training Session**
```bash
# Pre-warm with common training questions
core-agent cag:prewarm

# During training, ask questions quickly
core-agent cag:query "What is network reconnaissance?"
core-agent cag:query "How to perform port scanning?"
# These will be instant responses!
```

**Scenario 2: Daily Security Work**
```bash
# Check cache performance
core-agent cag:stats

# Ask about common security topics
core-agent cag:query "OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities"
core-agent cag:query "Incident response procedures"
```

**Scenario 3: Team Knowledge Sharing**
```bash
# Export your team's cache
core-agent cag:export team-cache.json

# Share with colleagues
# They can import it with:
core-agent cag:import team-cache.json
```

### **Troubleshooting CAG**

**Problem**: CAG responses are slow
**Solution**: Check if cache is working with `cag:stats`

**Problem**: Getting old information
**Solution**: Clear cache with `cag:clear`

**Problem**: Want fresh answers
**Solution**: Use regular queries instead of CAG

**Problem**: Cache not working
**Solution**: Restart the system and try `cag:prewarm`
