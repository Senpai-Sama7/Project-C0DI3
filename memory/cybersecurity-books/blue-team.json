The sender doesn’t care—it just sends, even if the receiver isn’t ready to accept the packet. See why it’s faster? Some applications that use UDP have builtin utilities to warn reciplents of undeliverable messages, but UDP doesn't. In other words, it depends on the higher layers of the TCP/IP stack to handle these problems. Think of UDP as someone announcing over a loudspeaker that school will be closed that alternoon.

The TCP/IP stack consists of four layers that perform diferent functions: Network, Application, Transport, and Internet. © The Applicatiom-layer pratocols are the front end to the lower-layer peatocols. Examples of protocals operating at this layer are HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, and SNMP. © The Transport layer is responsible for encapsulating data into segments and uses UDP or TCP beaders for managing the transmission of data. TCP is a connectlan-oriented protocol UDP is a connectioniess protocol TCP provides guaranteed delivery of data packets but ls slower than UDP, which does not guarantee delivery. © The critical components of TCP segment headers are TCP flags, the ISN, and source and destination port numbers.",

In this case, a tester or an attacker uses a technique called piggybacking. Piggybacking is trailing closely behind an employee who has access to an area without the employee realizing you didn’t use a PIN or a security badge to enter the area Those skilled in plggybacking watch authorized personnel enter secure areas and walt for the opportune time to Jain them quickly at the security entrance. They count on human nature and the desire of athers to be palite and hold open a secured door. This play usually works, especially li the plggybacker has both hands full and seems to be struggling to remove an access card tram a purse or pants pocket. Some plggybackers wear a jake badge around their necks or pretend to scan a security card across a card reader. Il they're detected, they might say thelr card has been giving them problems and use thelr social-engineering skills to canvince the security",

However, security testers can often guess passwords without needing a special program because some users are careless when creating passwords. For example, many users, despite guidelines in company security policies, use simple passwords, such as “password” or “p@$$wOrd.” Some systems also have detault legon credentials that users often neglect to change, such as a username of “admin” with a password that is also “admin”. You can lind Hsts of delauhk credentials for various devices on the Internet.

Missing a step can have disastrous effacts, so you should train yoursetf to think in a siructured, logical way.

Usualy, what's written is executable code that might give an attacker a backsioor Into the system, escalate an atracker's pridleges to that of an administrator, or simply crash the program.

Description: In the past, programmers had to read through thelr code line by fine before submitting the job to the mainframe CPU. The Job Indurted all the commands the CPU would execute. If a program was full of errors, the mainframe operator notified the programmer, who had to go through the code again and flx the errors. With today’s compliers, you can write a program, compile It, and test it yourself. If the compiler finds errors, t usually Indicates what they are so that you can correct the code and compile the program again. In this activity, you create a C program that contains errors and try Co comple the program. After seeing the errors generated, you correct the pragram and then recompile it unt you get #t right.",

Many programmers belleve the compiler should check far errors In their code, so they spend little time reading and stepping through thelr programs looking for syntax or logic errors, They just compile & program and see what errors pop up. Others refuse Co compile the program until they have examined the code thoroughly and are confident i's accurate and syntactically correct. For beginning programmers, examining the code carefully before compiling helps make you a better programmer.

Il low-privilege users know what URLs to request, they can escalate thelr privileges ln a poorty designed application. Insecure direct object references, described earlier, are discovered during authorization testing. Authorization testing can reveal major areas of concern and Is an important part of any application test. Input Validation Input validation Is the act of filtering, rejecting, or sanitizing a user's untrusted input before the application processes it. Input valldatlon problems can lead to data disclosure, alteratlon, and destruction. When applications accept untrusted Input, an attacker can often craft malicious requests that cause the application to perform an unexpected action. This is where the injection vulnerability arises. An attacker can cause a server to run code, overfill a buffer, perform database queries, reflect malicious content back to users, and many other destructive actions. One example of input validation gone wrong is SQL injection. Web applications thar prompt users for Information or display available inventory to users usually have a back-end database server storing all this information.

Uf nat successful, the server responds without delay. This, and other tricks, can be used to detect Blind SQL injection. SECURITY BYTES When studenss apply for graduate school, walting for an accepeance letter can be painfil, but a hacker offered them a way of getting an answer quickly. The hacker gained access to intemal acimissions records for Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and other top business schools by exploiting vwuinerabilides discovered In a web application called Apply'Yourself, The hacker then posted hacking hints on Business Week’ online forum. To read more, vist weww.thecrimson comvartice/2005/3/3! hacker-ips-off-b-schoo-appiicants-tipped/. Applicants, regardless of thelr hacidng backgraund, could now find out whether they had been accepted. Harvard Business School identified 119 applicants wha hacked the system and stared that It would reject thelr admissions because of the ethics violation. Some people thought the problem was the lack of security on the ApplyYourself web server, which alowed an attacker to simply modify the web server's displayed URL. The applicants who were caught used their logon names and changed only the URL when connected to the web server. They didn't aempt to hide thelr qacks or guess passwords. Was what they did unethical? This question might seem difilouk to answer, but Harvard had no problem doing just that. Although this incident occurred years ago, It's sdll a good lesson In poor website security and the repercussions of hacking. Error Handling Aweb application can be configured or written to handle errors in a varlety af ways. For example, when an application needs to undergo traubleshoating, developers can enable debugging, which pravides rich logging intarmation helplul 1a diagnose lesves. Sometimes, alter traubleshoating, the debugging mode might be leit on, which provides a valuable source of Information Jor attackers. Developers should minimize the amount of Information shared with users when an application encaunters an error. Optimally, na information or only a generic message shauld be displayed to users in these error cases. Cryptography Testing Cryptography can be intimidating for Junior security testers.

SECURITY BYTES Encryption has always been something someone wants to break, For some, t's the challenge of soMng a puzzle, For athers, breaking encryption enables them to listen to what two adversaries are discussing through emails, text messages, or any other media. Cyber attackers now take companies hostage by encrypting all af the company's data and demanding significant payments to decrypt It, Not char long ago, the Fal found an IPhone Sc owned by a deceased couple suspected of being Cerrorists. The Fal thought the phone migtt canain evidence or possible leacts to other attacks, but It couldnt break the phone's encryption. Apple, Inc, refused to assist the Fal citing chil liberties and freedom of speech. Consequently, the FBI hired a company of hackers to create a tool to break the iPhone's encrypdion.
