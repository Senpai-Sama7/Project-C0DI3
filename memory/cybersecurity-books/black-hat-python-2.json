You’ll see C code written for a kernel exploit, JavaScript code written for a JavaScript fuzzer, or a proxy written in a newer “hipper” language like Rust. But Python is still the workhorse in this industry. For my money, it is still the easiest language with which to get started, and with the large number of libraries available, it is the best language for quickly writing code to perform complex tasks in a simple way.

Then we check to make sure we don’t need to first initiate a connection to the remote side and request data before going into the main loop 2. Some server daemons will expect you to do this (FTP servers typically send a banner first, for example). We then use the receive_from function for both sides of the communication. It accepts a connected socket object and performs a receive. We dump the contents of the packet so that we can inspect it for anything interesting. Next, we hand the output to the response_handler function 3 and then send the received buffer to the local client. The rest of the proxy code is straightforward: we set up our loop to continually read from the local client, process the data, send it to the remote client, read from the remote client, process the data, and send it to the local client until we no longer detect any data. When there’s no data to send on either side of the connection 4, we close both the local and remote sockets and break out of the loop.",

Note that we are using promiscuous mode, which requires administrative privileges on Windows or root on Linux. Promiscuous mode allows us to sniff all packets that the network card sees, even those not destined for our specific host. Then we set a socket option 2 that includes the IP headers in our captured packets. The next step 3 is to determine if we are using Windows and, if so, perform the additional step of sending an IOCTL to the network card driver to enable promiscuous mode. If you’re running Windows in a virtual machine, you will likely get a notification that the guest operating system is enabling promiscuous mode; you, of course, will allow it. Now we are ready to actually perform some sniffing, and in this case we are simply printing out the entire raw packet 4 with no packet decoding. This is just to make sure we have the core of our sniffing code working. After a single packet is sniffed, we again test for Windows and then disable promiscuous mode 5 before exiting the script.",

These modules will be easy to modify and will work within the trojan framework developed in Chapter 7. In later chapters, we’ll explore privilege escalation techniques that you can deploy with your trojan.

System administrators in large enterprises commonly schedule tasks or services that execute child processes, or run VBScript or PowerShell scripts to automate activities. Vendors, too, often have automated, built-in tasks that behave the same way. We’ll try to take advantage of any high-privilege processes that handle files or execute binaries that are writable by low-privilege users.

This tells us which files the high-privilege processes are accessing. Finally, we’ll intercept the file-creation process by injecting our own scripting code into the file and make the high-privilege process execute a command shell.
