cd llama.cpp
rm -rf build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)
```

#### Step 2: Start LLM Server
```bash
# Start server with Gemma model
cd llama.cpp
./build/bin/server -m ../models/gemma-3n-E4B-it-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf --port 8000
```

#### Step 3: Test Full System
```bash
# Test with real LLM
export LLM_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
node bin/cli.js --health-check
```

### 3. Install and Configure Security Tools
**Priority**: Medium
**Time**: 2-4 hours
**Risk**: Low

```bash
# Install red team tools
sudo apt install nmap sqlmap

# Install blue team tools
sudo apt install snort suricata yara

# Test tool integration
node bin/cli.js --list-tools
```
