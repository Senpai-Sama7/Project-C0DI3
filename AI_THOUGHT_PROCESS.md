### 3. Reasoning Plan Generation

Based on input complexity, the AI selects and executes:

#### **For Simple Queries (Complexity < 0.3)**
```
Input → Zero-Shot Generation → Direct Response
```

#### **For Moderate Complexity (0.3 ≤ Complexity < 0.7)**
```
Input → Axiom Extraction → Hypothesis Generation →
Evolutionary Optimization → Verification → Solution
```

#### **For High Complexity (Complexity ≥ 0.7)**
```
Input → Principle Extraction → Concept Decomposition →
Ground Truth Establishment → Logical Inference →
Validation → Solution Synthesis
```

### 4. Knowledge Integration

During reasoning, the AI integrates cybersecurity knowledge by:

1. **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant concepts using vector similarity
2. **Context Enhancement**: Adds book content to reasoning context
3. **Prompt Augmentation**: Enhances generation prompts with knowledge
4. **Technique Application**: Suggests relevant tools and methods

### 5. Response Generation

The AI generates responses using:

- **Enhanced Prompts**: Include relevant cybersecurity knowledge
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Execute complex reasoning plans
